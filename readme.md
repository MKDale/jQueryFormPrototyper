#Prototype form interactions quickly with this kit of Examples

###What is this toolkit?
This toolkit is **a collection of common form field and input interactions** that you can use to bring some interactive magicalness to a static HTML prototype. 

###When should I use this toolkit?
If you have learned all you can from a static prototype, then it might be a good time to think about building an HTML version with a few targetted interactions that enables you to validate more complex usability concerns with users.

####How do I use this toolkit?
There is no css framework (like Twitter Bootstrap) used in these examples to make it easier for you drop them into an existing prototype. Think of it as interaction pizzazz that you can **sprinkle into an HTML prototype when and where it makes sense to get more detailed feedback from users**.
