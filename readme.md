#Prototype form interactions quickly with this toolkit

###What is this toolkit?
This toolkit is **a collection of common form field and input interactions** that you can use to bring some interactive magicalness to a static HTML prototype. 

###Why use this toolkit?
Have you reached a point of diminishing returns testing a static image+hotspot or HTML prototype? Are you unable to validate microinteractions in forms and inputs? Then a jQuery prototype built in the browser might be a good fit for you!

###When should I use this toolkit?
If you have learned all you can from a static prototype (wireframes, images, toothpicks+bubblegum), then it might be a good time to think about building an HTML version that enables you to validate more complex interactions with users.

####How do I use this toolkit?
There is no css framework (like Twitter Bootstrap) used in these examples to make it easier for you drop them into an existing prototype. Think of it as interaction pizzazz that you can **sprinkle into an HTML prototype when and where it makes sense to get more detailed feedback from users**.
